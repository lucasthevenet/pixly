# Custom Operations Support Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The current implementation of the image processing library requires all operations to be predefined in the core module. The `applyOperation` function uses a switch statement to handle specific operation types (`resize`, `rotate`, `flip`, `crop`). This approach limits extensibility as users cannot add their own custom operations without modifying the core library code.

The goal is to refactor the entire system to use a middleware-like function approach where all operations (including the current built-in ones) are implemented as functions that transform ImageData directly. This complete migration eliminates operation objects entirely. This will enable users to:
- Create custom image filters (e.g., sepia, grayscale, custom color adjustments)
- Implement specialized transformations (e.g., lens distortion correction, custom warping)
- Add domain-specific operations without forking the library
- Maintain type safety while extending functionality
- Compose operations more naturally using function composition

## Branch Name
`feature/custom-operations-support`

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Architecture Limitations
1. **Hard-coded Operation Types**: The `ImageOperation` type is a union of specific operation interfaces, making it impossible to add new operations without modifying the core types
2. **Switch Statement in applyOperation**: The operation application logic uses a switch statement that only handles predefined operation types
3. **Type Safety**: Need to maintain TypeScript type safety while migrating to functions
4. **Operation Pattern**: Current operations (flip, rotate, crop, resize) all follow the pattern: `async (src: ImageData, ...params) => Promise<ImageData>` - perfect for function conversion
5. **Missing blur operation**: There's a blur.ts file in operations but it's not integrated into the switch statement
6. **Migration Path**: Need to convert all existing operations to the new function style while maintaining the same API

### Design Considerations
1. **Function-Based Operations**: Operations become simple functions that accept and return ImageData
2. **No Registration Required**: Direct function passing eliminates the need for a registry
3. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript function types to maintain type safety
4. **Composability**: Natural function composition with existing pipe/compose utilities
5. **Performance**: Direct function calls without lookup overhead
6. **Simplicity**: Middleware pattern is familiar and easy to understand
7. **Error Handling**: Custom operations need robust error handling to prevent breaking the pipeline
8. **Parameter Closure**: Operation parameters are captured in closures, maintaining clean function signatures

### Proposed Architecture

```typescript
// Operation function type - middleware-like
type OperationFunction = (bitmap: ImageData) => Promise<ImageData>;

// All operations are now functions
type Operation = OperationFunction;

// Helper to create operation functions with parameters
function createOperation<T>(
  handler: (bitmap: ImageData, params: T) => Promise<ImageData>,
  params: T
): OperationFunction {
  return (bitmap: ImageData) => handler(bitmap, params);
}

// Migration of existing operations to function style
const resize = (options: ResizeOptions): OperationFunction =>
  createOperation(resizeImage, options);

const rotate = (angle: number, color: Color): OperationFunction =>
  createOperation(rotateImage, angle, color);

const flip = (direction: FlipDirection): OperationFunction =>
  createOperation(flipImage, direction);

const crop = (options: CropOptions): OperationFunction =>
  createOperation(cropImage, options);
```

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Feature Branch
- **Success Criteria**: Feature branch created from main
- **Commands**:
  - `git checkout main`
  - `git pull origin main`
  - `git checkout -b feature/custom-operations-support`

### Task 2: Design Function-Based Operation Types
- **Success Criteria**:

    processor: ImageProcessor,
    operation: Operation,
  ): Promise<ImageProcessor> => {
    if (!processor.bitmap) {
      return processor;
    }

    try {
      const newBitmap = await operation(processor.bitmap);
      return {
        ...processor,
        bitmap: newBitmap,

      return processedBitmap;
    },
    { method: 'average' }
  );

  // Direct function usage
  const customFilter: OperationFunction = async (bitmap) => {
    // Custom processing
