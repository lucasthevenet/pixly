# Image Resizing & Compressing Library Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The goal is to create a library that efficiently resizes and compresses images by leveraging multiple specialized image processing dependencies:  
`@jsquash/avif`, `@jsquash/jpeg`, `@jsquash/jxl`, `@jsquash/oxipng`, `@jsquash/png`, `@jsquash/qoi`, `@jsquash/resize`, and `@jsquash/webp`.

This library will enable users to easily convert and optimize images in various formats while providing a consistent API and CLI interface for integration into different workflows. By integrating these highly optimized libraries, we can deliver both high performance and quality output.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Dependency Compatibility:** Ensure that the multiple `@jsquash/*` packages work well together.
- **Performance:** Provide high performance for both resizing and compressing while keeping quality high.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle failed conversions or unsupported formats.
- **Extensibility:** Design the API in a modular way so that future enhancements or additional image formats can be integrated easily.
- **User Feedback:** Provide enough logging and error messages to help users debug issues if they arise.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Project Setup & Dependency Management**
    - Create a dedicated branch (`image-resize-compress`) off `main`.
    - Initialize the project structure (e.g., `src`, `tests`, etc.).
    - Install and document all the required dependencies.
    - Create a basic configuration file for the library.
    - **Success Criteria:** All dependencies are installed, project skeleton is ready, and branch is created.

2. **Core API & CLI Design**
    - Define a simple API that abstracts over the various image processing operations (resizing, compressing, format conversion).
    - Implement a CLI interface to allow users to process images from the command line.
    - Define and document configuration options (output format, quality settings, resize dimensions, etc.).
    - **Success Criteria:** API and CLI accept image input, options, and output processed images.

3. **Integration of Individual Libraries**
    - Set up each image processing dependency in a modular way so they can be easily used within the core API.
    - Start with one module (e.g., resizing using `@jsquash/resize`) and verify its functionality.
    - Incrementally add modules for format-specific compression:
        - AVIF: `@jsquash/avif`
        - JPEG: `@jsquash/jpeg`
        - JXL: `@jsquash/jxl`
        - PNG: `@jsquash/png`
        - QOI: `@jsquash/qoi`
        - WebP: `@jsquash/webp`
        - Optimize PNG files with `@jsquash/oxipng`
    - Each integration should include tests to verify output quality and performance.
    - **Success Criteria:** Each module is functional, tested, and can be used independently via the API.

4. **Testing and Validation**
    - Implement unit tests, integration tests, and example usage to validate individual modules and the overall system.
    - Ensure test coverage for various image formats and edge cases.
    - **Success Criteria:** All tests pass, and coverage is reported.

5. **Documentation and Examples**
    - Write usage instructions and examples for both API and CLI.
    - Provide guidance on how to configure the library for different use cases.
    - Document performance benchmarks and quality metrics.
    - **Success Criteria:** Documentation is clear, complete, and includes working examples.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Branch Creation:** A dedicated branch (`image-resize-compress`) is created.
- **Project Skeleton:** Project structure is set up and all dependencies are installed.
- **API and CLI:** A basic API and CLI are implemented enabling image input, resize, compress operations, and format conversion.
- **Library Integration:** At least one module (e.g., resizing) is fully integrated and functional; subsequent modules are planned with a modular integration approach.
- **Quality Tests:** Tests are in place covering primary functionality and edge cases.
- **Documentation:** Basic documentation is available outlining installation, usage, and configuration instructions.
