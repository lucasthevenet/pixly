## Current Task
- **Task**: Enable custom operations in image processing library
- **Implementation Plan**: `docs/implementation-plan/custom-operations-support.md`
- **Status**: Task 6 Complete - Custom Operation Builder Utilities Implemented
- **Created**: 2024-01-01
- **Planning Completed**: 2024-01-01
- **Architecture Revision**: 2024-01-01 - Changed from registry pattern to middleware-like function approach
- **Scope Expansion**: 2024-01-01 - Complete migration of all operations to function-based style (no legacy objects)
- **Key Findings**:
  - Current implementation uses a hard-coded switch statement in `applyOperation`
  - Discovered existing blur operation that needs integration
  - All operations follow pattern: `async (src: ImageData, ...params) => Promise<ImageData>`
  - Project uses Vitest for testing and unbuild for building
  - Multiple export paths already configured in package.json
  - Middleware approach is cleaner and more functional than registry pattern
  - All operations will be migrated to the new function style, eliminating operation objects entirely

## Task History
<!-- Previous tasks will be listed here -->

## Lessons Learned
- [2024-01-01] Always check for existing but unintegrated code (found blur.ts operation not in switch statement)
- [2024-01-01] Image operations in this library follow an immutable pattern - they return new ImageData
- [2024-01-01] The library already has a well-structured export system with multiple entry points
- [2024-01-01] Middleware-like function approach is simpler and more composable than registry pattern for extensibility
- [2024-01-01] Direct function passing eliminates complexity of registration and lookup mechanisms
- [2024-01-01] Complete migration to functions simplifies the codebase and improves performance by removing switch statements
- [2024-01-01] Task 6 completed with comprehensive custom operation utilities including createSafeOperation, isOperationFunction, validateOperationParams, composeOperations, and 9 built-in custom operations (brightness, contrast, grayscale, sepia, etc.)
- [2024-01-01] Added 102 comprehensive tests covering all custom operation utilities and built-in operations
- [2024-01-01] Created extensive documentation and examples showing basic usage, advanced patterns, type safety, and performance optimization techniques
