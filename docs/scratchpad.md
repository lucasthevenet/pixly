# Scratchpad

## Current Task
- **Task**: Rebuild API into more composable structure
- **Implementation Plan**: `docs/implementation-plan/composable-api-redesign.md`
- **Status**: Planning phase complete - Ready to begin implementation
- **Created**: 2024-12-20
- **Planning Completed**: 2024-12-20
- **Key Findings**:
  - Current API uses factory pattern with direct output methods
  - Target API needs fluent builder pattern with `.apply()` method
  - Preset system required for composing operations
  - Separate result object needed for output conversions
  - Breaking changes will require major version bump

## Task History
### Custom Operations Support (Completed 2024-01-01)
- **Task**: Enable custom operations in image processing library
- **Implementation Plan**: `docs/implementation-plan/custom-operations-support.md`
- **Status**: All Tasks 1-10 Complete - Custom Operations Feature Fully Implemented and Ready for Merge
- **Architecture Revision**: Changed from registry pattern to middleware-like function approach
- **Scope Expansion**: Complete migration of all operations to function-based style (no legacy objects)

## Lessons Learned
- [2024-01-01] Always check for existing but unintegrated code (found blur.ts operation not in switch statement)
- [2024-01-01] Image operations in this library follow an immutable pattern - they return new ImageData
- [2024-01-01] The library already has a well-structured export system with multiple entry points
- [2024-01-01] Middleware-like function approach is simpler and more composable than registry pattern for extensibility
- [2024-01-01] Direct function passing eliminates complexity of registration and lookup mechanisms
- [2024-01-01] Complete migration to functions simplifies the codebase and improves performance by removing switch statements
- [2024-01-01] Task 6 completed with comprehensive custom operation utilities including createSafeOperation, isOperationFunction, validateOperationParams, composeOperations, and 9 built-in custom operations (brightness, contrast, grayscale, sepia, etc.)
- [2024-01-01] Added 102 comprehensive tests covering all custom operation utilities and built-in operations
- [2024-01-01] Created extensive documentation and examples showing basic usage, advanced patterns, type safety, and performance optimization techniques
- [2024-01-01] Task 7 completed: Public API properly configured with all types and functions exported, tree-shaking compatibility maintained
- [2024-01-01] Task 8 completed: Comprehensive test suite with 102 tests passing across 3 environments, maintaining >90% code coverage
- [2024-01-01] Task 9 completed: Complete documentation moved to docs/custom-operations.md with examples, migration guide, and performance considerations
- [2024-01-01] Examples folder removed - standalone examples will be created at a later date, documentation contains inline examples for now
- [2024-01-01] Task 10 completed: Performance testing and optimization completed with documented performance considerations and architectural validation
- [2024-01-01] All tasks 1-10 successfully completed - Custom Operations Feature is fully implemented and ready for final review and merge
- [2024-12-20] When redesigning APIs, consider backward compatibility and provide migration paths
- [2024-12-20] Fluent/builder APIs should return new instances to maintain immutability
- [2024-12-20] Preset systems should compose operations into reusable functions
