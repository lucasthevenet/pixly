# Project Guidelines

1. When you start any task, always act like a planner.
2. Always refer to the latest documentation about any task you're working on using Context7 MCP.
3. Check to make sure the user has selected the Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet/Opus models. If they have not, ask them to select it before going any further.
4. Always review and follow all rules in .cursor/rules (or .windsurfrules)
5. Always refer to the README.md file in the root of the project when you want to run any command.
5. Make sure you refer docs/scratchpad.md for lessons learned.
6. Ask any questions that's not clear to you and make sure you understand the task before you start.
